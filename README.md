# NAME

TM2::DuckDNS - TempleScript extension

# SYNOPSIS

    # not to be used from Perl

# DESCRIPTION

This ontological extension allows TempleScript applications to use the [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org) service
to provide a given FQDN with an IP.

The usual scenario is that an Internet site is only given a public IP address on a temporary basis
(_dynamic IP_). To allow external servers to find and/or identify this site, **from the inside of the site** you
can send a beacon HTTP signal to DuckDNS.org to update the IP address the signal is launched from:

    %include file:duckdns.ts

    § isa ts:stream
    return
       <+ every 60 min                           # trigger on a regular basis
     | ( "my-subdomain-at-duckdns" )             # only the subdomain you registered before
     |->> duckdns:update ("124533-secret-duckdns-token-here")
     |->> io:write2log                           # logging is always a good idea

That should keep the FQDN uptodate:

    $ dig my-subdomain-at-duckdns.duckdns.at
    ...
    your.ip.he.re
