TM2::DuckDNS - TempleScript extension

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=pod

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # not to be used from Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This ontological extension allows TempleScript applications to use the L<DuckDNS|www.duckdns.org> service
to provide a given FQDN with an IP.

The usual scenario is that an Internet site is only given a public IP address on a temporary basis
(I<dynamic IP>). To allow external servers to find and/or identify this site, B<from the inside of the site> you
can send a beacon HTTP signal to DuckDNS.org to update the IP address the signal is launched from:

=encoding utf-8

   %include file:duckdns.ts

   ยง isa ts:stream
   return
      <+ every 60 min                           # trigger on a regular basis
    | ( "my-subdomain-at-duckdns" )             # only the subdomain you registered before
    |->> duckdns:update ("124533-secret-duckdns-token-here")
    |->> io:write2log                           # logging is always a good idea

That should keep the FQDN uptodate:

   dig my-subdomain-at-duckdns.duckdns.at
   ...
   your.ip.he.re
